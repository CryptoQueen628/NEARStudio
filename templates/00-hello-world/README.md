# HelloWorld example in AssemblyScript

## Description

The contract implements a single function to return "Hello, World!":
```
export function hello(): string {
  return "Hello, World!";
}
```

## To Run

*In NEAR Studio (https://studio.nearprotocol.com)*

1. Click the "Run" button on the top of the Studio window

2. You will be redirected to the new window that should display the following:
    
    
    Contract says:

    # Hello, World!


## To Test

*In NEAR Studio (https://studio.nearprotocol.com)*

1. Click the "Test" button on the top of the Studio window

2. You will be redirected to the output for the JavaScript tests described in `src/test.js` to show that the contract is performing properly.

## How to build from scratch

This is the simplest way to get started with writing code on blockchain with NEAR. 

Our backend code will reside in `assembly/main.ts`

We will create and export a function: 

<snippet id='hello-snippet'>
```TypeScript
// To be able to call this function in the contract we need to export it
// using `export` keyword. 

export function hello(): string {
  return "Hello, World!";
}
```
</snippet>

We need to write some tests

<snippet id='tests-snippet'>
```JavaScript
describe("Greeter", function() {
    let near;
    let contract;
    let alice;
    let bob = "bob.near";
    let eve = "eve.near";
  
    jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 10000;

    // Common setup below
    beforeAll(async function() {
      const config = await nearlib.dev.getConfig();
      near = await nearlib.dev.connect();
      alice = nearlib.dev.myAccountId;
      const url = new URL(window.location.href);
      config.contractName = url.searchParams.get("contractName");
      console.log("nearConfig", config);
      contract = await near.loadContract(config.contractName, {
        // NOTE: This configuration only needed while NEAR is still in development
        // View methods are read only. They don't modify the state, but usually return some value. 
        viewMethods: ["hello"],
        // Change methods can modify the state. But you don't receive the returned value when called.
        changeMethods: [],
        sender: alice
      });
    });

    // Multiple tests can be described below. Search Jasmine JS for documentation.
    describe("simple", function() {
      beforeAll(async function() {
        // There can be some common setup for each test.
      });
  
      it("get hello message", async function() {
        const result = await contract.hello();
        expect(result).toBe("Hello, World!");
      });
  });
});
```
</snippet>

We'll put some frontend code together now.

<snippet id='frontend-snippet'>
```JavaScript
async function doInitContract() {
  // Getting config from cookies that are provided by the NEAR Studio.
  const config = await nearlib.dev.getConfig();
  console.log("nearConfig", config);
  
  // Initializing connection to the NEAR DevNet.
  window.near = await nearlib.dev.connect();
  
  // Initializing our contract APIs by contract name and configuration.
  window.contract = await near.loadContract(config.contractName, {
    // NOTE: This configuration only needed while NEAR is still in development
    // View methods are read only. They don't modify the state, but usually return some value. 
    viewMethods: ["hello"],
    // Change methods can modify the state. But you don't receive the returned value when called.
    changeMethods: [],
    // Sender is the account ID to initialize transactions.
    // For devnet we create accounts on demand. See other examples on how to authorize accounts.
    sender: nearlib.dev.myAccountId
  });

  // Once everything is ready, we can start using contract
  return doWork();
}

// Using initialized contract
async function doWork() {
  // Calling method hello on the blockchain for our contract.
  // .hello() returns a promise which we awaiting.
  const message = await contract.hello();
  // Displaying the message once we have it.
  document.getElementById('contract-message').innerText = message;
}

// COMMON CODE BELOW:
// Loads nearlib and this contract into window scope.

window.nearInitPromise = doInitContract().catch(console.error);
```
</snippet>

Finally, we'll tie these together with a little html
